        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>External CSS style sheet allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes design changes easier.</li>
          <li>A selector defines the element or attributes to which the rules, or declarations, will apply.</li>
          <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property.</li>
          <li>Do Not Repeat Yourself (DRY) is a coding principle that encourages developers to reuse or share pieces of code in order to reduce the number of lines of code that need to be written or maintained.</li>

          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>Declare a variable, give the variable a name, use assignment operator (=) to assign specific data 
            var shape= “circle”</li>
          <li>All strings are separated by a comma</li>
          <li>Script.js is linked within the body of the element.</li>

          <li>The console.log method was created to make it easier for developers to test their code.</li>

          <li>JavaScript is read form top to bottom</li>
          <li>Arrays are especially useful when we want to perform a task on multiple pieces of data at once.</li>
          <li>A single array can store different types of data, such as strings, numbers, and so on</li>
          <li>Variables within an array are identified by an index, starting with 0</li>
          <li>You can write a for loop to execute an array with multiple variables. </li>
          <li>A for loop consists of a three part conditional statement </li>
          <li>A function declaration uses the “function” keyword to define the function. </li>
          <li>Code block comes after the definition of the function. It can also be called the function body.</li>
          <li>We use function to define and reuse blocks of code.</li>
